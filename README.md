Developer Portfolio – Assignment 6
📌 Project Description

This project is the final individual assignment of the course and consists of a multi-page developer portfolio website. The portfolio presents me as a Front End Developer and also functions as a personal CV.

The main purpose of this project is to showcase my technical skills, previous work, and ability to build responsive, accessible, and well-structured web applications. While education can open doors, a strong portfolio demonstrates real-world skills and practical experience.
